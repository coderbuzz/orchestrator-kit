# Changelog

## 0.1.0 (2026-10-13)
First release, extracted from qumatic/company-os (history of the kit files kept).
- Packs: `pack.yaml` manifest (names, project file, state dir, human id and tool prefix, vocabulary, plugin/MCP/hook).
- Company catalog + project roster (`company-os/project/2`: roster, goal), `<human_prefix>staff`, 80% daily budget notice.
- Generators: role library (15 roles), `new-company`, `hire`, `new-project`, `org`; default orchestrator skill.
- Profiling battery (12 deterministic tasks through the Router) and `match` (proposals only).
- Registrable evidence checks (unregistered `special` fails), generic hook, core schemas as package data.
- Fix: the claude-code builder sends a self-contained result schema (`../ai/1` was unresolvable by `claude --json-schema`).
